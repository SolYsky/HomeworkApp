Let‚Äôs learn more about NoteEditor and some of its best features you can start playing with. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to [[Welcome to NoteEditor]] or skip to the final note, [[NoteEditor Pro]]. 

## Work Anywhere ‚òÅÔ∏è
Your notes are automatically saved as you write; that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no save button. üòÑ 

NoteEditor uses Apple‚Äôs CloudKit for sync, available via an in-app subscription to [NoteEditor Pro](NoteEditor://x-callback-url/open-NoteEditor-pro). All your notes will stay in sync across NoteEditor for iPad, iPhone, and Mac.

NoteEditor also supports Handoff between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device and *instantly* switch.

## Publish Everywhere
The *info panel*, reachable via the ‚ìò icon in the Editor, has all your export options for when it‚Äôs time to send your notes and prose elsewhere (available with an in-app NoteEditor Pro subscription). You can export to PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even create images of your writing, which are handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.

## The Details
In that information panel you can also find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *read time*.

## Tags and Sub-Tags
One of NoteEditor‚Äôs most powerful features is *tags*. When you add a word with a pound sign like this #welcome, NoteEditor treats that as a sort of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. It's a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.

You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they‚Äôre created on the fly. Just use a word with a pound sign, and NoteEditor takes care of the rest. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of NoteEditor‚Äôs window. See [[Welcome to NoteEditor]] to learn more about NoteEditor‚Äôs layout and other core features.

### But wait, there‚Äôs more! 
NoteEditor can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag #welcome/organize . The /organize/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of /welcome/!

Sub-tags work like folders in the sidebar. Tap or click the close/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organizational power with tags in NoteEditor, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.

Finally, NoteEditor supports *multi-word tags* for example: #welcome/tags multiword# Just surround the words with a pound sign on either end.
